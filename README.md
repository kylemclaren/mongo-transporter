# Mongo Transporter

A simple Go app that uses the [Compose Transporter](https://github.com/compose/transporter) to transfer data between two MongoDB deployments and keep them in sync.

## What's it good for?

- Keeping dev, staging and production DB's in sync.
- Zero-downtime migrations from one deployment to another.

<!--

## What it does

- connect to both the source and the destination and finds the oplog timestamp
- copies unique indexes from source to destination (changing their namespace)
- copies users
- copies all the collections in parallel
- copies non-unique indexes
- tails the oplog from the initial timestamp, and applies the operations in a batch (ignoring a list of blacklisted - - commands, dropDatabase, etc). There is no conflict resolution with Transporter. When writing to the source and the destination, the last write always wins.

## Deploy!

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/kylemclaren/mongo-transporter)

Click the deploy button to launch a new app instance, add your config/environment variables in the Heroku dashboard and click "Deploy for Free". This will create a new Heroku app. Worker dynos do not scale automatically when deploying, you will need to scale manually to one worker dyno via the dashboard or the command line: `heroku ps:scale worker=1 -a 'YOUR APP NAME'`

For now, Mongo Transporter will only sync a single DB on a deployment so if a deployment has multiple DB's, you will have to run multiple app instances. To run a "continuous sync", you will need to use this with a MongoDB replica set, this is because a replica set includes the `oplog.rs` collection on the `local` DB. Transporter "tails" this collection to keep the two deployments in sync.

~**Golang on Heroku is not yet officially supported so use at your own risk.**~
No longer true: https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/7/7/go_support_now_official_on_heroku
Need to work on native support now and remove the buildpack

## Config vars

- `SOURCE_MONGO_URL` - This is the full connection URI of the MongoDB deployment that you want to sync **from**. eg. `mongodb://username:strongpassword@candidate.33.mongolayer.com:30000,candidate.34.mongolayer.com:30000/local?authSource=prod_db` You will need to [create a user](https://github.com/kylemclaren/mongo-transporter/wiki/Creating-a-MongoDB-oplog-user) that can read from the `local.oplog.rs` namespace. You can use both members of the replica set.
- `SOURCE_DB` - The DB name to sync from. eg. `prod_db`
- `SINK_MONGO_URL` - This is the full connection URI of the MongoDB deployment that you want to sync **to**. eg. `mongodb://username:strongpassword@candidate.43.mongolayer.com:30000,candidate.44.mongolayer.com:30000/staging_db` The user does not need to authenticate to the `local` DB but needs read write access to `SINK_DB`. You can use both members of the replica set.
- `SINK_DB` - The DB name to sync from. eg. `staging_db`
- `TAIL` - Specify true to run a continuous sync, tailing the oplog. False for a one-time sync.
- `DEBUG` - Specify true for verbose logging to stdout.

Run `$ heroku logs -ta MY_APP_NAME` from the command line to check out the logs.

<!-- Note that the users for both the source and destination deployments must use a user with [oplog access](https://docs.compose.io/common-questions/getting-oplog-access.html). -->

## What is does

- Connect to both the source and the destination and finds the oplog timestamp
- Copies all the collections in parallel
- Tails the oplog from the initial timestamp, and applies the operations in a batch (ignoring a list of blacklisted commands - dropDatabase, etc). There is no conflict resolution with Transporter. When writing to the source and the destination, the last write always wins.

## What it does not do

- Copy DB users
- Copy indexes

You will have to recreate any (non-unique) indexes and create new users on the destination DB, a small trade-off for the ease of use.

## Thanks

The engineers at [Compose](https://compose.io) for making an awesome tool, Transporter.


This app uses the [Go Buildpack for Heroku](https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go) by @kr

## To Do

- [ ] 2.4/2.6/3.0 caveats (if any)
- [ ] Comma separated list of collections to ignore
- [ ] Improve log output
- [ ] Slack notifications
